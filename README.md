# bamazonCustomer

bamazonCustomer is the greatest command-line storefront in existence AFAIK. When executed, it will display all products ever stocked, along with a choice of those products that are currently available.

If the user is uninterested in purchasing anything, (s)he is expeditiously booted from the app.

OTOH, if the user picks an available product, (s)he is prompted for the quantity (default is 1).

If (s)he picks 0, or more than what is currently in stock, (s)he is remprimanded and promptly reprompted.

If the user somehow gets it right, the total price is calculated, the purchased quantity is removed from stock, and the user is once again prompted to buy more stuff.
